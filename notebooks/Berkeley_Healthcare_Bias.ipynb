    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively manage patients, health systems often need to estimate particular\n",
    "patients' health risks. Using quantitative measures, or \"risk scores,\"\n",
    "healthcare providers can prioritize patients and allocate resources to patients\n",
    "who need them most.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we examine an algorithm widely-used in industry to establish quantitative risk scores for patients. This algorithm uses *medical cost* (i.e., the amount a patient spends on medical care) as a proxy for risk. Through analysis of this data, we will discover how this algorithm embeds a bias against Black patients, undervaluing their medical risk relative to White patients. Crucially, this bias is not immediately visible when comparing medical costs across White and Black pateints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight of [Obermeyer et al's work](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6464/447) is that bias frequently slips into algorithmic systems unnoticed, particularly when sensitive characteristics (such as race) are ommitted or backgrounded in the data science process. In this case, bias in algorithms affects people's lives very concretely: the bias in the algorithm described here would make it more difficult for Black patients to recieve the care they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will learn how to uncover bias in algorithms, using the medical risk score example from Obermeyer et al's paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agenda\n",

    "- Investigate relationship between medical cost and risk by race\n",
    "- Investigate relationship between chronic illness and risk by race\n",

    "To help hospitals and insurance companies identify patients who should qualify for “high-risk care management” programs, the algorithm assigns each patient a risk score. It predicts a patient’s total medical expenditure based on data from insurance claims (age, sex, diagnosis codes, etc.) and uses this variable as a proxy for health care needs.  Patient risk scores are then generated as functions of their predicted expenditures.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the model is calibrated across race in terms of risk score and expenditure, Black and White patients with a given risk score should have similar total medical expenditures, on average.\n",

    "## Conclusions and takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Even systems that appear balanced across racial groups at first glance may belie underlying biases in the datasets. Thus, seemingly unbiased predictors can in fact be highly correlated with a biasing variable such as race, gender, income or other relational characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, bias emerged from using an indicator of need (cost) that was itself influenced by race. Biased estimation of need between races resulted.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the ways in which race influences health care cost, here is a segment from Obermeyer et al’s paper:\n",
    " \n",
    ">The literature broadly suggests two main potential channels. **First, poor patients face substantial barriers to accessing health care, even when enrolled in insurance plans.** Although the population we study is entirely insured, there are many other mechanisms by which poverty can lead to disparities in use of health care: geography and differential access to transportation, competing demands from jobs or child care, or knowledge of reasons to seek care (1-3). To the extent that race and socioeconomic status are correlated, these factors will differentially affect Black patients. **Second, race could affect costs directly via several channels: direct (“taste-based”) discrimination, changes to the doctor–patient relationship, or others. A recent trial randomly assigned Black patients to a Black or White primary care provider and found significantly higher uptake of recommended preventive care when the provider was Black (4).** This is perhaps the most rigorous demonstration of this effect, and it fits with a larger literature on potential mechanisms by which race can affect health care directly. For example, it has long been documented that Black patients have reduced trust in the health care system (5), a fact that some studies trace to the revelations of the Tuskegee study and other adverse experiences (6). A substantial literature in psychology has documented physicians’ differential perceptions of Black patients, in terms of intelligence, affiliation (7), or pain tolerance (8). **Thus, whether it is communication, trust, or bias, something about the interactions of Black patients with the health care system itself leads to reduced use of health care. The collective effect of these many channels is to lower health spending substantially for Black patients, conditional on need—a finding that has been appreciated for at least two decades (9).**"
