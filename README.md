# study-algorithmic-bias

This is a collaborative project to study algorithmic bias with students from 
ASDRP.  

Our goals for participants include:

* Understand what is algorithmic bias, and in particular bias in AI and ML algorithms.

* Study a few major algorithmic faux pax made by well intentioned engineers.  We will study (possibly) unintentional consequences of algorithms leading to unfair biases.

* Hypothesize how to mitigate as much as possible biases inherent in computer algorithms and data sets, as as to minimize harm to society.

We intend for you to engage in serious scientific investigation in groups, and to learn how to leverage each group member in your research.  No major research is done alone in the real world.  We expect that each group will pursue the writeup of your research in a peer-review worthy publication.
